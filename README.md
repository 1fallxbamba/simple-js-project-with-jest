# Bamba Fall's Ceasar encryption test with Nightwatch


# Looks like Vite doesn't support hot reload so i had to create a command that rebuilds and previews the app every time


# Running the app

```
npm run reload
```

# Running the end-to-end tests

```
npm run e2eTest
```

# Nightwatch's 'assert.containsText' is deprecated so I used 'assert.textContains'
